# Vendure Import Products Plugin

-   This plugin imports the products from the specified url every specified day.

-   The products are expected to be in the following format

```ts
  {
    "Items": [
        {
            "name": string,
            "id": string,
            "price": string,
            "unit": string,
            "group": string,
            "sku": string,
            "Collection": string,
            "parentfacet": string,
            "childfacet": string
        },
    ]
  }
```

## Getting Started

1. Run

```bash
  npm i @nestjs/axios @nestjs/schedule axios ts-node
```

2. And then add this to your `vendure-config.ts`.

```ts
import { ProductImportPlugin } from 'vendure-plugin-import-products';

ProductImportPlugin.init({
    url: `https://tfcmayasoftdata.up.railway.app/allproducts`,
    everyThisDay: 3,
});
```

This means the products will be imported from the specified url every third day.

3. Make sure to run database migrations after updating your `vendure-config.ts`
